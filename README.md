Find All Duplicates
Write a function (in python) or method (in Java) that accepts a list of integers and returns a list of only those integers that appear more than once.

Approach 1: Nested Loop Solution
- Involves comparing each number in the list to every other number to check for duplicates
- pros: simple to understand and implement
- cons: can be slow especially for larger lists

Approach 2: Dictionary or Map-Based Solution
- Uses a dictionary (or map) to keep track of how many times a number appears
- pros: faster especially for larger lists
- cons: requries extra memory
